In the old days for every news event there were probably hundreds of journalists writing about the same story for their own local newspapers. Now because of the efficiency of the Internet and search engines a few journalists writing about it would suffice for the whole country. People would be able to find them. There is no reason why hundreds of newspapers should write and publish their own versions of the same story.</i>»<p>And yet you can still find incompetent people.  I've read so many inaccuracies grammar and typographic mistakes from information <i>professionals</i> (apparently) that makes me wonder if the price to pay for such efficiency is too high.  And I'm talking as a consumer information consumer.<p>«<i>Corporations are increasingly getting bigger (in terms of market caps) more global and more powerful yet they are getting smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people they employ because they have mastered the art of efficiency.</i>»<p>Okay take IKEA for example.  IKEA sells furniture and other home accessories world wide and everywhere you can find the same model.  However how many people do they employ on each store?  A hundred?  I don't know but I'm under the impression that is not a shrinking number.  And IKEA is a particularly good example because it's expansion model is not based on a franchise like fast food restaurants.<p>Of course I might not understood the intention of the author.\""
